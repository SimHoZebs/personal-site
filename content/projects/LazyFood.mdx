## Inspiration

Many of us would like to keep better track of our own diet, but let's be honest - logging food is a pain.

Apps expect you to know exactly what you ate. You have to search through a complex database, and good luck if it's a home cooked meal!

Wouldn't it be great if your app just *knows* the nutritional value of the food you ate?

## What it does

### Intuitive logging

Making exact queries for database sucks. Just type natural language. Oh, you don't want to type? Just speak to it? Oh, you don't want to speak? Fine, just take a picture of your food!

Log multiple foods. Log for multiple DAYS. LazyFood understands it all.

### Personalized estimates
To ensure you get the most accurate estimates, LazyFood can also ask a short set of brief, multiple choice questions to help clarify important factors about your meal (such as if a food was fried or baked, used whole wheat bread or white, etc.).

Additionally, if you have regular patterns in your diet - such as always eating baked chips as opposed to fried - LazyFood allows you to save these patterns as memories to always be taken into account when you log a meal.
