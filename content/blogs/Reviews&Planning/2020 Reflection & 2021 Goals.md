For 2020, I spent majority of it on getting used to the army. I attempted to learn Kivy, tried to get in to reading books on computer science, and learned ALOT for Unity game development. I wish I studied algorithms more efficiently and plan things out better in general.

For 2021, I hope to release a small game, learn web development and get in to freelancing more actively. 2020 was alot of learning, and I hope this year is the one I can show what I learned.
