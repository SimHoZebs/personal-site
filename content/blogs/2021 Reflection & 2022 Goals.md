Web development was the highlight of 2021. I'm now actively learning full-stack web dev, and fairly confident with the front-end. Out of all things, the most important thing I learned was that this is something I'd really enjoy pursuing a career in.

I learned that solo game dev is insane amount of work. I can code, but understanding level/game/sound design and doing 2/3D art all on my own is too much to invest my time in. I did not release a game, but it was a lot of fun and gave me deeper insight as to how games work.

Freelancing is anxiety-inducing, and ton of marketing for small return in such a competitive market. I met a lot of unique people - CEOs of start ups, people looking to build one, and so on.  It was a good experience, but not enough to make it a career.

2022 continues with more attempts at showing off my skills. I'll continue building interesting projects and share the things I learn more. I hope to do more freelancing and meet more people. I'll take a look at data science & AI and see where they could take me.
