## 2019/DEC/27th (Day 1)

Today isn't the first day I attempted to learn UI Development. My first attempt goes few months back with **Tkinter**. Quite quickly, I had hard time with the tutorial I found; It was horrible now that I think back to it, and unhelpful keeping my motivation going. Later on I decided to jump on it again with a bit more research on UI libraries, which landed me on **PyQt5**. This library was so much more modern and intuitive, and QtDesigner was quite a surprise. But within an hour I figured that I want to learn how to _code_ my UI, not have a software do it for me. The tutorial I was watching mainly focused on QtDesigner, so I stopped again.

Today is where I'm motivated enough for the third time. I've done a bit more research before today, and found that **PySide2** is almost identical to PyQt5, but has a huge advantage of having a friendly license of use. I also found out about Kivy, but some website said that Qt is the way to go. I don't know if Kivy is actually worse, but I don't care enough to dive in to that. Similar reason goes to why I'm using Python for UI development in the first place - I don't care enough to dive in to serious development, and all I know is Python at the moment. I do plan to learn JavaScript and C++ in the future.

I'm using [LearnPyQt](https://www.learnpyqt.com/) website to learn, and it's pretty convenient. It's free (the text version anyway), and the tutorial is pretty good at explaining things. I've gone through 2 parts of the first chapter and so far it's been going pretty well. I'm gonna finish this day off writing the key things that I want to remember in the future.

- `self.setGeometry()` can take `self.left`, `self.top` arguments and set a size and position on launch.
- Qpixmap functions save state changes to the object calling it. It does not need to be reassigned.
