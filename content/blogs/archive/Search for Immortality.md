I'm still a fresh 19 years old, but god, I hate aging.

I mean, imagine a game where as you progress, your character's maximum health score falls, your strength gets weaker, beauty stats decrease, and slowly and inevitably reach a point where you can't do anything. Nobody would want to play such a stupid game where all your work is for naught. I like to take that thought a bit further - I think it's dumb that I have to die after spending so much time trying to live.

So what's making this life system so crappy? Why do we die, and how can we stop it?

## 1. Death by trauma.

About 437,000 died from intentional homicide in 2012[^1]. 1,400,000 died from road injuries in 2016[^2], and close to 800,000 suicides every year[^3]. People also die during work, drown, from war, and many other causes that I couldn't find numbers for. These cause of death is birthed from conflict, accidents and issues with safety - things that can't simply be solved with science.

Of course, science can help in many ways. Road injuries for example, can be mitigated significantly if self-driving cars were common.

If we consider that about 56,000,000 dies every year[^4], about 5% of deaths every year are by trauma. (These numbers most likely have duplications, such as some road injuries being intentional homicide, but let's ignore that possibility and add the numbers up (we can say that the extra number counts for other cause of deaths such as drowning))

"The current causes of aging in humans are cell loss (without replacement), DNA damage, oncogenic nuclear mutations and epimutations, cell senescence, mitochondrial mutations, lysosomal aggregates, extracellular aggregates, random extracellular cross-linking, immune system decline, and endocrine changes. Eliminating aging would require finding a solution to each of these causes, a program de Grey calls engineered negligible senescence."[^5]
