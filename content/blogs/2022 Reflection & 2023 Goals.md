2022 was one of the most unexpected years of my life. I was kept busy with moving to another country and pursuing computer science, dropping my beloved study in biotechnology.

In terms of the goals I mentioned in 2021, last year was sort of a failure. I didn't meet people - in fact, I think it was the most alone I've been in my life. I didn't see the point of forming connections before moving to the US, and once I did, I got way too busy adjusting. I didn't get to look at data science & AI - I didn't even have time to work on projects. Again, I was just so busy. I was constantly playing catch up with school and meeting ends meet without any time to work on a project, let alone explore other studies.

Regardless, some of the best life decisions have been made that year. I always wanted to study in the US and felt that software engineering fit me better than anything; I finally feel like I'm on the right track toward my dream life. I didn't get to develop much, but I continued to read a lot and formed philosophies & ideas regarding software. Especially, I learned that interoperable, offline-first apps are ideal; I want to make ML-powered tools and create productivity tools.

In 2023, I'll meet more people with similar interests and find opportunities to gain real developer experience. I'll make content sharing what I think and learn. I'll finish building my projects and truly prove what I am capable of.
