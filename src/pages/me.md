## Who Am I?

My name is Ho Sim, but I go by "Simho" in most forms of communication for reasons I'll simply put as: that's what I've been called throughout my life in Korea and Malaysia.

For the last few years, I've been trying build systems that privately organize all personal information and create apps that reveal insights from them. There's more data about me than ever before - instead of leaving them to be used for nothing but personalizing ads and YouTube feed, let's use it to improve understanding of ourselves. My budgeting app, [Nedon](projects/Nedon.md), is a small, but important piece of this effort.

I'm also very invested in technologies that empower individuals to get more done and enhance digital freedom. Example:
- Notion is one of the most powerful tools that empower individuals to get more done. AppFlowy aims to do the same without the worry of the tool disappearing when it stops being maintained.
- LLMs unlock incredible opportunities. SLMs designed to run locally eliminates dependence from LLM providers.
- Google Photos is great, but never eternal. Immich is.

<small>(I am not anti-corporate, I just appreciate open source and non-profit work.)</small>

This all stems from my philosophy - everyone should be free and powerful enough to protect their freedom. Yes, I know, **most people** agree with this. The arguments are always *how* that should be achieved. I'm still highlighting it here because I want to spend the rest of my life figuring out that *how* and working towards it.  

## What Am I Doing Now?

Other than building [Nedon](../content/projects/Nedon.md) in my spare time, I'm pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science at University of Central Florida. I am a mentor at KnightHacks, pushing students to build skills outside of classes.

Professionally, I am doing a software engineering internship at SRAM, mainly handling DevOps and Backend development.

I am looking for full-time opportunities to work with web technologies in a software-driven organization.
