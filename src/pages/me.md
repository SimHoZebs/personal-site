## Who Am I?

My name is Ho Sim, but I go by "Simho" in most forms of communication as that's what I've been called throughout my life in Korea and Malaysia. You can [read my resume here](cv.md).

For the last few years, I've been trying to build systems that helps people learn about themselves better than ever before, all while respecting their privacy.

Think about it: our personal data is scattered throughout the world, with their quality and accuracy higher than ever before. advertisers use them to build our profile with a precision so high, they probably understand you better than you understand yourself! How about we finally make them useful for us? [Nedon](../../content/projects/Nedon.md) is a small, but meaningful effort towards that reality.

I'm also very invested in technologies that empower individuals to get more done and enhance digital freedom. Example:

- Social media platforms (ArtStation, BlueSky, YouTube, Discord) empower free speech and freedom of expression to everyone in the world.
- Power tools (Notion, Obsidian, Figma) are some of the most powerful tools to organize information and empower individuals to get more done.
- Artificial Intelligence; LLMs recognize patterns much better than typical software and have high potential to free up humans to spend their time more meaningfully.
- Open source alternatives of all of the above takes an extra step at enhancing digital freedom and independence.

This all stems from my philosophy - everyone should be free and powerful enough to protect their freedom. **Most people** agree with this, but it's infinitely difficult to answer _how_ humanity should take that path. I want to spend the rest of my life discovering the answers.

In the meantime, I do my best to share what I've learned with the world in digestible mediums.

I am looking for full-time opportunities to work with web technologies in a software-driven organization.
