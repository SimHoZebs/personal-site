## Who Am I?

My name is Ho Sim, but I go by "Simho" in most forms of communication for reasons I'll simply put as: that's what I've been called throughout my life in Korea and Malaysia.

For the last few years, I've been trying to build systems that privately organize all personal information and create apps that reveal insights from them. There's more data about me than ever before - instead of leaving them to be used for nothing but personalizing ads and YouTube feeds, let's use it to improve understanding of ourselves. My budgeting app, [Nedon](projects/Nedon.md), is a small, but important piece of this effort.

I'm also very invested in technologies that empower individuals to get more done and enhance digital freedom. Example:

- Social media platforms - like ArtStation, Twitter, YouTube, Discord - empowers free speech and freedom of expression to everyone in the world.
- Power tools - like Notion, Obsidian, Figma, - are some of the most powerful tools to organize information and empower individuals to get more done.
- Artificial Intelligence - recognizes patterns much better than typical software and frees up humans to spend their time more meaningfully.
- Open source alternatives of all of the above takes an extra step at enhancing digital freedom and independence.

This all stems from my philosophy - everyone should be free and powerful enough to protect their freedom. **Most people** agree with this, but it's infinitely difficult to answer _how_ humanity should take that path. I want to spend the rest of my life discovering the answers.

## What Am I Doing Now?

Other than building [Nedon](../content/projects/Nedon.md) in my spare time, I'm pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science at University of Central Florida. I am a mentor at KnightHacks, pushing students to build skills outside of classes.

Professionally, I am doing a software engineering internship at SRAM, mainly handling DevOps and Backend development.

I am looking for full-time opportunities to work with web technologies in a software-driven organization.
