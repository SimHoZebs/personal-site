Even if I grow up to be the greatest person, the one regret I’ll definetly have is for the lost memories of my past. For the periods of time that were vital to me but are gone without a trace. My time that has disappeared in to nothing. And it’s even worse, because I have attempted to save them in writings. But I have lost the diaries due to mistakes. All I’d have is the present.
