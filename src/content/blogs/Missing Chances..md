I had an idea about a glasses with an infra-red laser attached on its frame that scans the surrounding and displays whatever digital object/s of user’s desire on the lenses(screen) while considering the environment it is displayed on. In other words, Microsoft HoloLens. Yeah, just after few months, Microsoft announced their product. At first, I thought,&nbsp;“Damn, I was late by just few months!”, until I found out they patented the technology like, 5 years before.

I don’t remember the next one I was late on, but it was another tech idea I had that was again announced few months later.

Since mid 2016 I was developing my idea on Universal Income. It didn’t even have a name until Elon Musk hit the headlines with one. I even have a 1k+ words long draft in my Drafts section right now.

And recently, I felt this feeling of being late again. That I’ve missed my chance by staying silent about my dreams and ideas. And that was on the job opportunities for cellular agriculture research organisations not needing any biologists or bioengineers. Obviously, I read them wrong. How could research centres that depend heavily on biology ever have enough biologists, right? When I misread it, though, I thought it was obvious that they did have enough biologists because they wouldn’t be able to start any research if they don’t have them from the beginning. I thought they were now already at the end stage of their research, and was now looking to do little tweaks and for people who could make commercial sales in the near future possible. For a week, I didn’t know how I should feel about my life goal being achieved without me taking part in it. I was slowly on my way to look for other life goals, perhaps even change my career path to nanotech, but fortunately I found out there is still plenty of room left for biologists in cellular agriculture.

Really, all the ideas I’ve thought of so far, has been thought by someone else way before. I wonder if I voiced them out earlier it would’ve been better. I’m not sure what I mean by better. Maybe I hope more people knew that I had these ideas before they were popularly announced to the media. Maybe I’m just afraid for my future where I could truly miss my chance to do something and call it my own work by staying silent for too long.
