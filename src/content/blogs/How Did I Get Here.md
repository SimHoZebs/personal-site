I guess thunders do strike.

I lived most of my life without a thought of pursuing computer science. In fact, I lived most of my childhood without thinking much at all. I just entertained myself with whatever I enjoyed whether I was good at them or not. I mean, _sure_, I got into computer games early on. As a Korean kid born in 1999, I played a bunch of Flash games on various websites and Maplestory for quite some time. But the first time I started investing creativity into what I do was after my move to Malaysia at the age of 8.

## Before the Internet

Like most kids, we found ways to do anything but pay attention to the class. When we weren't sending secret notes or throwing balls of eraser dusts, we passed around a sheet of paper or an empty exercise book after drawing a panel or two. Some concluded by the end of the class, but some went on for days with an unpredictable, chaotic, and random story - exactly what we enjoyed.

I eventually took this more seriously and started a long-term comic called Cure For a Devil. Like in previous comics, my classmates represented all the characters, with each having a special power/unique concept. There was not much of a story, but it still featured good-ol' randomness and cool fights, which was good enough for my friends to beg for more.

My first comic, 악마치료법(Cure For a Devil)

As we grew older, everyone's standard for comics rose, including my own. I became more conscious of its shallow storyline and my poor drawing skills. I eventually scraped the whole thing and started a redraw, but ultimately lost interest in continuing it. I still do a bit of world-building whenever it comes up in my mind, but the comic was never finished and now exists only in my memories.

During my comic-drawing days, "Book-RPGs" started getting popular among my friend group. It was somewhat like DnD (if my understanding of DnD is correct) - the game creator would set up a book with pages of UI for player stats and inventory, in-game shops, combat areas, and so on. The creator would repeatedly erase and draw on top of these pages to indicate gameplay while players made their decisions verbally. No two games were the same, but they were all inspired by some computer games or TV shows we enjoyed.

Mine was a sandbox game where you start on an island, build your base, and invade other islands with the army you build along the way; kind of like a mix of RimWorld and Minecraft, except much shittier. This game got so popular among my friends, that I killed the player base of other games and even made money for the first time through microtransactions![^money] But this, too, eventually faded from fame by other interests.

## The Internet

Facebook Zero: text-only version of Facebook for the early days of mobile internet.

I was born late enough for the Internet to have existed, but too soon for it to be accessible. That was partly because my mom was very restrictive about what I can do on our family computer, but it was also because smartphones just started becoming a thing in 2010. Back then, I had to write Korean text messages in English alphabets because there was no other way you could type on the phones sold in Malaysia. I don't think we even had Wi-Fi until much later!

Once my age hit double digits, I read cringey romance novels shared among my friends' Facebook groups. They were either popular ones from Korea shared as .txt files or fanfics my friends wrote on Facebook Notes (a feature that no longer exists). I tried writing my own, but I gave up after writing about two chapters.

Then there was this rising entertainment platform called YouTube. By then, my mom had an iPhone 3GS where I watched my first anime (School Days (yes, it was traumatic)) and skits from YouTubers like Smosh. I tried making the latter as well, solely relying on the pause/resume button on my phone camera. If even one thing went wrong, we were back to recording the first scene. It was quite an unfortunate time to be oblivious to video editor software. Again, I gave up after a few tries.

My first and only animation stored on my computer.

Then I found [Pencilmation](https://www.youtube.com/@pencilmation). Again, I had to make my own. I worked with the pause/resume button to make stop-motion animations for a while before I found a [tutorial on animating using Microsoft PowerPoint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HyZN0yhrkI). I started learning Macromedia Flash after discovering animators like [Hyun](https://www.youtube.com/@Hyun/), [MondoMedia](https://www.youtube.com/@MondoMedia), and [FlashDeckAnimations](https://www.youtube.com/@flashdeckanimations), where I spent a decent amount of time learning keyframe interpolation and various animation techniques. I ended up creating several short animations and even planned to make a YouTube channel for it.

## My Childhood as a YouTuber

It didn't take long for me to discover the [first Minecraft video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxzwaJmpYwc) I ever watched, which I weirdly remember to this day. That led to discovering AntVenom, YogsCast, Sky, EditZP, and many others that I don't even remember anymore. Soon, Minecraft not only became the only game I played, but also the game that brought together the friends I still chat with to this day.

As I religiously watched Minecraft content and learned about the game, I started to get slightly frustrated with people's gameplay. They were either missing the obvious or lacking game knowledge; they could be playing better! I believed I could play better than them. To prove it, I started my own YouTube channel and show people how you truly play Minecraft. The best player.

![](../../assets/blogs/old-screen.jpg)
Hence the name.

I started my channel with nothing but my handed-down laptop that could barely play Minecraft, let alone record. Its spec was so terrible that I had to compress my recordings overnight so my video editor functioned with reasonable performance. I didn't have the money to buy the game or recording software (OBS did not exist yet), so I pirated them (I jumped between FRAPS, Bandicam, and Playclaw) while acting confused when skins didn't work properly.

That wasn't all. Back then, videos weren't as easy to discover as it is now. Advertising on other platforms was essential, and for Minecraft, it was on MinecraftForum and PlanetMinecraft. I looked for maps and mods that weren't already shared by prominent YouTubers and contacted the developers whenever I made videos on them. They'd then post my video on their main post as a showcase of what they built, and I'd get some publicity and grow my channel.

It probably took more than a year to reach 20, 30 subscribers. But by the time I tried to make a "Thank You" video for 50 subscribers, I was already at a hundred. When I tried to make one for 500, I was at 1000. My channel peaked at around 5000 subscribers by 2014. I was a partner of a content network called TGN, which allowed me to receive revenue through PayPal (while YouTube limited to physical checks with a minimum $100 withdrawal). I didn't make much, of course, but it was enough to buy games for friends who had cash in their hands but couldn't ask their parents. I eventually bought myself Minecraft, too. It was also the first time I went to a bank, pulled out a check from Google, and handed it to my mom.

Weekly view count, peaking at 18,960 views/week (Jul 6-12th, 2014)

YouTube was an incredible experience; it was the first time I actively tried to make something for the world to see and successfully managed to do so... Well, sort of. I uploaded over 150 videos throughout 4 years, but only a handful of them got more than 100 views. At some point, I began to think most of my videos were not entertaining.

The moment this realization really hit was when I left TGN. At some point in my career, I decided to pursue a better partnership network; and despite TGN offering a larger revenue cut, I ended my contract. Soon after, most of my best-performing videos were taken down for _having too many tags_. I was furious at first, but I gradually realized that the real issue was how most videos performed poorly. Being funny was hard, and I wasn't good at it.

## Engineering

Despite how integral YouTube was to my childhood, I never considered it as a professional career. Throughout that time, I somehow knew I wanted to do something with science when I grew older.

I don't know what got me so interested. I just was. One of my dream careers was to become an astronaut so I could see things most people could never see in their lifetime. When I made my Book-RPG, I studied specifically for players to filter seawater to drinkable water, make paper, fertilize plants, and so on, based on real science. In 6th grade, I had a list of questions I hoped to answer one day:

- How would it feel to reach the end of the universe?
- How does CPR even help?
- How does jumping help you grow taller?
- How do energies convert from one to another?

My curiosity only grew bigger as I moved to 7th grade, leaning towards Physics. My favorite activity during breaks was studying Physics with my friends, discussing whether light was a particle or a wave, about the Big Bang and the universe's expansion, and so on. I learned new things in school for sure, but a lot seemed terribly simplified and sometimes contradictory. When I proved how Bohr's atomic model made no sense, I quickly became the guy that "asks more than what we need to know for the exams".

![A segment of a Reddit comment that reads: You know, for an 'O' level student your insight into these questions is remarkable. During my 'O' level days I didn't give a shit about covalent bonds, all I knew was that they shared electrons. I applaud you for your effort and curiousity!](../../assets/blogs/compliment.png)
A comment on a question I asked on Reddit. I love compliments.

Once I got stuck on quantum mechanics, engineering won over a significant portion of my interests. I participated in a nationwide engineering competition at 14, being one of two in our school to get through the written assessment and make it through the quarterfinals[^masmo]. 'Physics of the Impossible' by Michio Kaku became my most influential book - I learned that nothing was impossible if we tried hard enough.

But even before all this, I had an inherent passion for creating things. I drew comics because I wanted to _create_ my own comic. I wanted to _create_ my own web-novel, Book-RPG, YouTube skits, Minecraft videos, and so on. I always had an overwhelming confidence - almost comparable to narcissism - that I could do better than others if I tried hard enough. How my mindset differs from narcissism is realizing when I am delusional and enjoying finding massive room for improvement.

By 2015, I had a clear goal in mind for the first time in my life. I wanted to build remotely controllable humanoid robots, similar to the ones seen in Iron Man 3 (though my inspiration came elsewhere). I believed that would allow people to work in or explore areas too dangerous for real humans to exist in. Imagine if we could conduct lunar missions from Earth, remotely controlling a humanoid robot sitting on the Moon! Or imagine going on a trip to the other side of the planet without the hassle of physical travel. You could remote into one of the robots and explore the world as if you were actually there. This technology would not only benefit the physical world, but serve as a stepping stone to our inevitable future - virtual reality[^1].

## Then, Biotech

I returned to Korea in 2015 as my parents could no longer pay for my school fees in Malaysia. I transferred to a Korean public school filled with students who couldn't care less to be there, which made it really easy for me to stand out to the teachers. I was recommended to apply for 청소년과학영재사사 ()

I was never interested in Biology. It was just a boring subject that I happened to score better than Physics. I even said that it was a pointless subject that was explaining what Physics already covered. But one day, I began to question the _value_ of my dream and started seeing Biology in a new light.

But by the time I was back in Korea[^korea], I began to question the value of remotely controllable humanoid robots. In a world where with countless other problems, I found it hard to justify its necessity. None of this mattered if our society wasn't around to use it. I needed the world to be sustainable first before I could build fun things; so I went back to the drawing board and wrote down all the major global issues I was aware of. I drew a diagram showing the relationship between land pollution & scarcity, water pollution & scarcity, world hunger, air pollution, excess waste and lack of management, etc. This short reflection resulted with a shocking conclusion: agriculture needs a revolution. I say "shocking", because it never occurred to me that producing food was unsustainable. I mean, haven't we been doing that since existence?

## ... Then, Software

## Now

[^money]: I didn't make a lot of money, of course. I made one or two sales on cosmetic upgrades. Making money wasn't the point anyway - all I was doing was copying the cosmetic shops from Maplestory. With few friends actually buying them, I had officially invented microtransactions in 2009.
[^The-best]: Hence the channel: https://youtube.com/@BestsGameplay
[^1]: In a world where we strive for maximum efficiency, virtual reality will be the only reality in the future. I'll make a post about this later.
[^masmo]: I'm still proud of the mechanical arm I built back then; it was impressive, considering I was never taught how to build one.
[^korea]: Financial constraints forced our family to return to Korea and finish high school there instead.
