I guess thunders do strike.

I lived most of my life without a thought of pursuing computer science. In fact, I lived most of my childhood without thinking much at all. I just entertained myself with whatever I enjoyed whether I was good at them or not. I mean, *sure*, I got into computer games early on. As a Korean kid born in 1999, I played bunch of Flash games on various websites and Maplestory for quite some time. But the first time I started investing creativity into what I do was after my move to Malaysia at the age of 8.

## Before the Internet

Like most kids, we found ways to do anything but pay attention to the class. When we weren't sending secret notes or throwing balls of eraser dusts, we passed around a sheet of paper or an empty exercise book after drawing a panel or two. Some concluded by the end of the class, but some went on for days with an unpredictable, chaotic, and random story - exactly what we enjoyed.

I eventually took this more seriously and started a long-term comic called Cure For a Devil. Like in previous comics, my classmates represented all the characters, with each having a special power/unique concept. There was not much of a story, but it still featured good-ol' randomness and cool fights, which was good enough for my friends to beg for more.

As we grew older, everyone's standard for comics rose, including my own. I became more conscious about the shallow storyline and poor drawing skills. I eventually scraped the whole thing and started a redraw, but ultimately lost interest in continuing it. I still do a bit of world-building whenever it comes up in my mind, but the comic was never finished and now exists only in my memories.

During my comic-drawing days, "Book-RPGs" started getting popular among my friend group. It was somewhat like DnD (if my understanding of DnD is correct) - the game creator would set up a book with pages of UI for player stats and inventory, in-game shops, combat areas, and so on. The creator would repeatedly erase and draw on top of these pages to indicate gameplay while players made their decisions verbally. No two games were the same, but they were all inspired by some computer games or TV shows we enjoyed. 

Mine was a sandbox game where you start on an island, build your base, and invade other islands with the army you build along the way; kind of like a mix of RimWorld and Minecraft, except much shittier. This game got so popular among my friends, I killed the playerbase of other games and even made money for the first time through microtransactions![^money] But this, too, eventually faded from fame by other interests.
## The Internet, then YouTube

The Internet always existed throughout my life but it was never very accessible. It was partly because my mom was very restrictive about what I can do on our family computer, but also because smartphones just started becoming a thing at 2010. 2010, the only way I could play computer games was by sneaking from my mom to a cyber-cafe. My home never had a proper PC, and I don't even remember having Wi-Fi until much later. Smartphones were obviously not even a thing yet. But as my age hit double digits, I faintly remember having a family desktop my mom made sure I couldn't play games on, and using [Facebook Zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_Zero) read cringey romance novels through my friends' Facebook groups. More popular ones from Korea were shared as .txt files, whereas the ones my friends wrote were shared as "notes" in the Facebook groups (a feature that no longer exists). I tried writing my own, but I gave up after writing about two chapters.

There was a rising entertainment platform called YouTube, where I watched my first anime and skits from YouTubers like Smosh. I tried making these too, solely relying on pause/resume button on my phone camera. If even one thing went wrong, we were back to recording the first scene. It was quite an unfortunate time to be oblivious to a video editor software. At some point, I discovered stick figure animations and was inspired to make my own. I quick-tapped pause/resume button to record stop-motion animations until I learned how to animate using Microsoft PowerPoint. (Thanks, cstyle12 (I'm sure that is his name, but it seems like he deleted all the videos)). Eventually, I learned to animate on Macromedia Flash, thanks to artists like Hyun. I spent a decent amount of time learning keyframe interpolation, and various animation techniques, and even made a 15 second long clip of a guy fighting a wall.

It didn't take long for me to discover my first Minecraft video, which I weirdly remember to this day: it was the COD zombie mod showcase by CaptainSparklez. That led to discovering AntVenom, YogsCast, Sky, EditZP, and many others that I don't even remember anymore. I watched their playthroughs religiously, and was instantly hooked on the game.

After some time, I started to find slight frustrations with the Minecraft content on YouTube. These YouTubers were either missing the obvious or lacked game knowledge. They weren't being as efficient as they could be. I believed I could play better than them, and to prove it, I started my own YouTube channel and show people how you truly play Minecraft. The best player[^the-best].

## My First 'Career' - YouTube

The word "career" wasn't on my mind when I started uploading videos, but it was the first time I actively tried to make something for the world to see. I spent all day recording mod reviews and adventure map playthroughs, then went to sleep with my laptop rendering videos overnight. I started with no money, a pirated copy of Minecraft and FRAPS (a recording software popular before OBS existed), random free video editor, and my terrible laptop with half a gig of RAM (That's right; 512MB RAM in 2012). By the peak of my YouTube career, I gathered around 5000 subscribers and became a partner at TGN because they let me receive revenue through PayPal (YouTube limited to checks with minimum $100 withdrawal). It wasn't a lot, of course, but it was enough to buy games for friends who had cash in their hands but couldn't ask their parents. I eventually bought myself Minecraft, too. It was also the first time I went to a bank, pulled out a check from Google, and gave my mom.

YouTube was an incredible experience, but my channel was fragile. Despite all the effort I put in my videos, most of them performed poorly. Vast majority of my views and subscribers came from a handful of videos, with just a single video being responsible for more than half of them. When I left TGN to pursue better partners, most of my best performing videos were coincidentally taken down. This was when I realized that being fun wasn't easy. I wasn't a great entertainer.

## Engineering

Whenever I was asked what I wanted to do when I grew up, it always had something to do with science. I don't know why. Perhaps my exposure to the 살아남기 시리즈 (Survival Series, an educational comic series showing how to survive various environments and situations) played a role, or just my fascination with the mysteries outside of our planet and the desire to explore it. At 6th grade, I wrote a page listing questions I hoped to answer one day:

- How would it feel to reach the end of the universe?
- How does CPR even help?
- How does jumping help you grow taller?
- How do energies convert from one to another?

My curiosity only grew bigger as I moved to 7th grade. Everything we learned seemed terribly simplified and sometimes contradictory. When I proved how Bohr's atomic model makes no sense, I quickly became the guy that "asks more than what we need to know for the exams". I get that sentiment, but it was hard for me to study something that didn't make sense. 

What I did consider was something related with engineering, though I'm not sure what exactly got me into it. It seems that I have inherent passion in making things on my own. When I learned to animate, I also tried to make point-and-click games with Powerpoint, and simple games with Macromedia Flash. As I played Minecraft, I tried to make a mod of the book-based RPG I used to host in elementary school. Not only is Java a complex language already, learning to make a mod without basic understanding of programming was way too difficult for my 12~14 year old brain. I still managed to implement different properties and made custom blocks and enjoyed doing it. I believe this was my first sign to become a software developer.

However, I was more interested in mechanical engineering. I turned 14, I competed in a nation-wide engineering competition called MASMO Iken Scientifica at 14, and I was extremely interested in Physics. My two friends and I would casually share our understanding of our universe, discussing whether light was a particle or a wave, about the big bang and the universe's expansion, and so on. One of my favorite books I read as a kid was 'Physics of the Impossible' by Michio Kaku, which opened my eyes to the world of physics and engineering. However, I fell out of love with Physics when I learned about quantum mechanics (my child brain refused to believe the world worked that way), allowing me to stay loyal to pure mechanical engineering.

By 2015, I had a clear goal in mind - to build remotely controllable humanoid robots. The idea is pretty much the same as in Iron Man 3, where Tony sits in a toilet to control one of his suits before it smashes into pieces from a truck (though my inspiration came from elsewhere). I believed that would allow people to work in or explore areas too dangerous for real humans to exist in. Imagine if we could conduct lunar missions from Earth, remotely controlling a humanoid robot sitting on the Moon! Or imagine going on a trip to the other side of the planet without the hassle of physical travel. You could remote into one of the robots and explore the world as if you were actually there. This technology would not only benefit the physical world, but serve as a stepping stone to our inevitable future - virtual reality[^1].

## Shift to Biotech

I was never interested in Biology. It was just a boring subject that I happened to score better than Physics. But one day, I began to question the value of remotely controllable humanoid robots. In a world where with countless other problems, I found it hard to justify its necessity. None of this mattered if our society wasn't around to use it. I needed the world to be sustainable first before I could build fun things; so I went back to the drawing board and wrote down all the major global issues I was aware of. I drew a diagram showing the relationship between land pollution & scarcity, water pollution & scarcity, world hunger, air pollution, excess waste and lacking management, etc. This short reflection resulted with a shocking conclusion: agriculture needs a revolution.  I say "shocking", because it never occurred to me that producing food was unsustainable. I mean, haven't we been doing that since existence?

## Biotech or Software?

## Now

[^money]: I didn't make a lot of money, of course. I made one or two sales on cosmetic upgrades. Making money wasn't the point anyway - all I was doing was copying the cosmetic shops from Maplestory. With few friends actually buying them, I had officially invented microtransactions in 2009.
