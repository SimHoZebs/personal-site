In some games there’s always those items that you don’t know if you’ll get more of them later on and if you should save them for something that might show up later. Just in case.

I don’t want to die just in case I get a reason to live later. Maybe something interesting will happen.

I just hope it doesn’t stay like the items I never get to use till the end.
