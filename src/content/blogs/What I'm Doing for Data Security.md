## Requirements
Personal data should be
### 1. manageable by the owner (ownership)
 This is the most important clause. If I have an image, video, text message, or any data, I should have access to all of it at all times and the freedom to do whatever I want with them. They should only disappear when I - and only I - want it deleted.
 
I can deal with Google exploiting my personal information. I'll probably never go out of my way to mask my network traffic with Tor. But I must always have authority over the history of my digital activity.
### 2. accessed only by authorized individuals (authority)
If I'm chatting with my mom, it should just stay with my mom.
### 3. analyzed and optimized to extract useful information (usefulness)
This isn't necessary, but a desire.

## Operating Systems
The main issue with operating system is data authority. Even if you toggle off all options in your privacy settings, you will always share some data with Microsoft, Google, and Apple, and in turn, every third party they work with.

The solution, is of course, to use an open-source alternative, like Ubuntu(x86/ARM systems) and LineageOS (mobile).  **However, I am not going to change anything about it.**

- Windows and Mac are terrible options, of course
### Solution: Use Linux-based OS.

## Telecommunication/Internet Service Providers
- 
### Solutions and fallback[^ignored]
1. Signal
   - E2EE, stores minimum amount of metadata.
   - Pretty much no average people use it.
2. Telegram
   - E2EE, stores very little metadata, but more than Signal.
   - More popular than Signal, but still unused by most.
3. E2EE RCS (only texts and files)
   - E2EE, but RCS is a closed standard. What's [available online](https://www.gsma.com/newsroom/wp-content/uploads//RCC.71-v2.5-6.pdf) seems old.
   - RCS itself is not E2EE, so it depends on Apple whether this is going to be part of the standard.
   - Replacing SMS, meaning vast majority of the US will use it eventually.
4. WhatsApp
   - E2EE, but do I trust Meta to not have a backdoor for governments or for themselves?
   - Most popular alternative to SMS at the moment.
5. Discord (only texts and calls)
- No E2EE, but is unavoidable with larger communities.

6. via Telecom Service Provider 
The last resort. Not only is there no E2EE, but there is no form of encryption whatsoever even while transit unlike HTTPS (which at least have TLS/SSL).

These solutions cover text, voice, video, and file communication to a limited extent. None of the apps mentioned offer functionalities to distinctively "announce" something, categorize discussions, and many other features found in Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, and alike. This is important, because while the mentioned platforms are popular for public use, many users also create private communities and/or mainly use them to interact with their friends and family, which all should remain private.

Email: @duck.com when possible.
## Public communication
As discussed before, many use social media platforms specifically to interact with the public. YouTube, Tiktok, Twitter, LinkedIn, Medium - each exist to serve unique purpose (with)
In reference to all forms of communication done in spaces designated for anyone to participate.

[^ignored]: I'm only listing common use cases and ignoring specific apps like Slack/Teams (for work & school), Kakaotalk (people in Korea), and Instagram (Reels sharing zone).
