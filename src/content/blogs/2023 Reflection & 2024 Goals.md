## 2023 Reflection

> *Meet more people... and find opportunities to gain real developer experience.*

A lot changed very quickly after I started my Bachelor's in Computer Science.

I participated in two largest Hackathons in Florida and secured second place in Google's challenge, and first place in RBC & Microsoft's challenge. I absolutely enjoyed hacking together a quick product with friends and learned I'm pretty comfortable taking the role of a leader when it comes to software development.

I started volunteering as a developer for a research lab - the first time I started working with a team long term. This was challenging on some aspects, but it mostly verified my understanding and knowledge of asynchronous communication, software development, and project management. It's been a good experience for improving clear communication of ideas and managing safe, incremental enhancement/migration of codebase.

I also spoke with dozens of recruiters and people within the industry throughout my internship search. There were a lot of scuffed moments, but ultimately, I am much better speaking to strangers than I was before. 

Did I learn anything from recruiters and employees? To be honest, not really. I already knew these big corporations give great benefits, and they always say their company has a great culture. The description of their projects are always too vague to walk away with much meaningful knowledge. The only memorable conversations I have is complaining to Google employees that Google Podcast is dying and privacy concerns with proprietary LLMs.

Unexpectedly, the most meaningful conversation was with a senior dev at my marriage brunch. His perspective of how software development changed over time (why Java and C# exists at all, how languages had proprietary compilers) and security and efficiency considerations he has when building software was insightful.

> *\[...] sharing what I think and learn.*

This website - It's a space that displays all my social links, projects I built, and all thoughts I want to share. I published a post about Rust by the end of the year, so I consider this goal sufficiently achieved.

> *I'll finish building my projects...*

The developer version of, "I'll start working out from next year". While I have built new projects through the hackathons, I still haven't built a personal project to completion. It takes a lot of time and effort, which has been hard to find amongst my investment to do well in school.

## Unexpected achievements
I have way better understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms. Even though I had experience with DSA prior to my school's DSA course, it taught me how to utilize them better and improve my overall understanding significantly. Learning C and Rust alongside it truly opened my eyes to how programs really work.

## Unexpected loss
I lost my translation job, making me practically unemployed. I restarted my Fiverr career, but it hasn't been great. I'm going to a little career fair in school tomorrow to look for a part time job at school, but I should also find more freelance gigs I could sell.

## 2024 Goals
It's way too late to have a goal statement for the year, but if I pretended today was the anywhere close to the start of the year:

I will land a software engineering internship and find a more stable source of income. I want to continue sharing my ideas and knowledge through my blog posts. I want to complete my projects and keep building to enhance personal data control.
