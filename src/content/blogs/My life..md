I’d be extremely honest with this post if I never shared my personal information, but I have it everywhere. There are no lies in this, though.

I have 3 alarms set for weekday mornings: 6:30, 7:00, 7:15. 6:30 is for me to wake up and shower before I go on with the day, but most of the time I fail to wake up at this time. I leave my phone on my desk before I go to sleep, which is considerably far enough for my need to stand up to turn the alarm off, but somehow I always wake up around 7:20 with the phone by my head.

I sit up to see my cats look back at me, jumping around meowing for food. Everytime I walk towards my door, they both rush outside thinking I’m about to give them food. I don’t, until I am done washing my face and changing my clothes.

I’m suppose to be in school till 7:50, but by now it’s already 7:35, too late for me to arrive with my walking speed. Fortunately, the first hour is a voluntary self-study class that takes place on top of our school library, the room in the picture above. As a student in a special class for top tier students, being absent for this probably doesn’t do any good to me. But I get to eat my cornflakes, so that is fine with me.

After unnecessary checks on my phone, taking a shit, and checking 74 times whether I left anything behind, I walk out of my apartment by 8. From on here there are two possible situations: Either it’s an annoyingly cold winter, or it’s the sweatiest summer of my entire life. I’ll talk about the former situation in this post. I’m the fluffiest man alive with the weirdest choice of clothes, slowly walking towards my school. I would normally ride a bike and it’d only take 7 ~ 10 minutes, but since I slipped and almost hit my head too hard on the road while riding a bike during winter before, I have no other safer choice than walking for around 25 minutes. I could probably reach there by 15 minutes, but I walk the long way around the school so that I can be alone outside of buildings as long as I can. I enjoy that, for some reason. My Earth Science teacher (soon he no longer will be, since I’m moving up a year) lives nearby so I rarely meet him on the way. Same goes for my biology teacher, who have taught me the subject for 2 years now. It’d be a surprise to have her teaching me again next year.

I used to play Hearthstone on my way, but after watching a TED Talk recently, I switched to listening to podcasts from HowStuffWorks.com. I’m starting from their very first podcasts, made 6 years ago. I don’t know if the commentators change, but I really like the girl’s voice. I can’t say why for sure.

Once I get near enough to my school to see the zebra cross and the lights for it, it’s green. I’m too far to cross it in time, unless I run, but I don’t run. It takes 43 centuries for the next green light to turn on, so I walk as slowly and comfortable as I can till the start of the zebra cross. I recall the memories of the days where I’d see the lights not even operating because I’m arriving before 8, and make another pointless determination to sleep early, wake up, and leave home to get to school in time. I still have to wait another 30 centuries, so I just stand there like that statue behind me that rose 15 centuries ago, half trying to see if the teacher on the other side makes an eye contact with me. I’d be more comfortable if they do, because then I can bow to say hi and not act like they don’t exist as I cross the road.

I’d ride the elevator up to 5th floor if I was earlier, but since I’m not, I use the stairs. This is because the elevator is like 100 metres away when I enter through one of many entrances of my school, and there is always someone waiting for the elevator. I can’t see which floor the elevator is at, but I’m sure it’s coming down, and I won’t be able to ride it in time, unless I run, but I don’t, run.
