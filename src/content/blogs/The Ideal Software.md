title: The Ideal Software
summary: Social apps don't compete by features, but their pool of data. We don't use YouTube because it services the best video watching experience. Twitter is extremely limiting in long form writing, but many go through the hassle of making threads. Instagram could get rid of video posts entirely, and people would still use it; not because of the app, but because their friend and popular personalities still share their lives on it. As long as companies own a self-sustaining well of content creators and consumers, even if there are objectively better alternatives, they mean nothing without your favorite people.

Back in the old days, YouTube channel pages were customizable. I'm not talking about the banner on the header; I mean the entire page. This was a feature locked behind the YouTube Partners Program, which was the only way a channel could monetize their videos back then.

Just few months after I started my Minecraft YouTube channel, YouTube changed their policy to allow anyone to monetize their video, along with visual overhaul. This included the removal of channel customization; you couldn't even put up a banner like you can now. People were furious, and handful of people still miss the level of personalization and branding capabilities of the older YouTube.

Countless more controversial changes were made since then (Please bring back the dislike button), all which we never really had a say in. Sure, we had _some_ say. Companies are, in some ways, bound to design their products to be desirable. But in the past few years, YouTube and many other companies have made more and more questionable, even outright anti-consumer decisions that resulted not in the loss, but in fact, improvement to their infinite growth. Turns out, they never had to give us what we want in order for us to stay.

## How to Create Something Bad and Keep People Using It

Social apps don't compete by features, but their pool of data. We don't use YouTube because it services the best video watching experience; Vimeo and PornHub could do exactly the same. The only difference is their massive pool of quality content creators. Twitter is extremely limiting in long form writing, but many go through the hassle of making threads because all that matters is reaching a large pool of readers. Instagram could get rid of video posts entirely, and people would still use it. Not because of the app, but because their friend and their favorite personalities still share their lives on it. As long as companies own a self-sustaining well of content creators and consumers, innovation isn't necessary. Even if there are objectively better alternatives, it doesn't matter if your favorite people aren't there.

## Nobody Owns Anything Anymore

The rights gained from paying $15 a month on Netflix is simple: A temporary right to access their library of content. You don't own the library nor a copy of it, which is why they can easily remove shows without getting into trouble. Strangely, the same logic applies to single purchases. Amazon Prime Video has deleted movies people have purchased, and Ubisoft plans to remove access to old games, even offline ones. This is still legal, because nobody ever owns what they purchased nowadays, not even a copy of it. You only get the right to access them until they can't be accessed.

## Is The Internet Really Free?

It's strange to think about paying money for Facebook, Twitter, or Google, but we manage to make these companies profitable at an infinite rate. We became comfortable with the idea of paying with our privacy instead of money, leaving it to the company's mercy. I say 'mercy', but we all know that our data is never safe with anyone else but ourselves. It is never if, but when we see the news about how our data was exploited or leaked. This will not stop, unless the global trillion dollar market of personal data collection is completely destroyed.

## The Grim Future

It feels like every day we are getting closer and closer to the Dystopian science-fiction fantasies of societies ruled by huge corporations. In a way, I already feel that we are. Several sex-workers are unable to access banks because their work is not accepted by the massive transaction companies (VISA, MasterCard, etc.). I can't download torrents without a VPN without my ISP yelling at me that it's illegal - which they know because they track all of my internet activities. Mental Outlaw showed how challenging, and practically impossible it is to stop companies from gathering private information from our phones.

## Local-first software

One of the reasons I love Obsidian is because it's a local-first software. Such software are difficult to come by nowadays. Every company loves to sell SaaS instead. I am at a company's connected to a cloud database that could be shut down at any point in time due to the failure of the company.

A local-first software is built completely against this. There are several ways a

Ideal Software and Their Limitations

I've been thinking a lot about decentralization and privacy lately, especially after reading [Jacky's post on data neutrality](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/towards-data-neutrality/). It is one of many writings that left a great impression on the kind of future I'd like to see. This post mostly goes over my idea of what the ideal software architecture, what kind of work is being done regarding them, their limitations, and how they may be alleviated.

This entire section, and a decent bit of this post, can be seen in . I highly recommend reading it.

## Blockchain

I appreciate its zero-trust system, but its requirement for a validator makes me question its feasibility. My focus instead has been on P2P technologies and utilizing them where they

[[People should be able to do whatever they want whenever they want.]] That's an integral part of the reason why our society functions the way it does. Agriculture gave us freedom in the selection of food, industrialization has given us freedom by getting more things done in less amount of time, and technology has enabled us to do things we were previous incapable of. Every progress we make is so we have more freedom to give our attention to something else we care about.

However, we've been noticing a trend of the trade-off we have to make for freedom: control. Control over our privacy is the main currency we use to surf the internet for free.

I'm not here to talk about blockchain. In fact, I actually think blockchain is a failure in decentralization efforts. The countless failures of cryptocurrencies proves it. Its requirement of validators requires an incentive for them to exist, in which only monetary incentives work.

Data neutral

To understand what data neutral software is, you must first understand what data neutrality is.
A software with following properties:

## What is data neutrality?

id:: 254b98da-80ad-4a5b-b8bb-b1bb3e5d3c38

Data neutrality is decentralization of data and application market.

## Why should I care about data neutrality?

Because decentralization destroys
I care a lot about people having more control over their data. Applications should thrive from their features, not because of the data they've collected

### How can data neutrality be achieved?

Software needs to be offline, and only have local access to data. Internet access has the potential for it to send that data to a centralized server of the developer. 2. Software

### Recommendation

This is problematic as there is no way for anyone to be recommended or suggested.

### Competition with centralized alternatives

Centralized data is incredible powerful and useful. They can do more than what a data neutral app could do.

Solution: accept this cant beat centralized alternatives if people dont care about privacy.

### Online connections

Softwares need to be built to access data from a decentralized source.

Data should not be able to be sent to a location where the user has not explicitly specified to be shared to.

User data should exist only in a location where the user desires.

Should be decentralized as possible, or/and allow people to create their own central node.

Should be easy for people to modify the software.

Should be designed with APIs that allow high compatibility with other software.

People should own the version of the software they pay for.

The definition of ‘own’ is the right to make and control changes within the purchased version of the software.
