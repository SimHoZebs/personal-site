Before I say anything, this is about my thoughts and feelings I get about the camp program by looking at the provided list of activities, not that I’ve been selected for it.

So now that I have my point straight, let me explain what ‘POSTECH’ even is. Well, actually, I would if I actually had readers, but since I don’t, I’ll just link their [website](http://wwwhome.postech.ac.kr/web/eng/ersh_02_02) and I guess you can see it for yourself.

The reason for this post is to clear up my conflict and be clear about how I feel about the camp’s program. 

POSTECH, [one of the best technology universities](http://www.home.postech.ac.kr/web/eng/eint_05_05) in Korea, is inviting 50 students all over the country to learn and experience things from their facilities for 3 days and 2 nights. There are around 2000 high schools in Korea, and a school can only recommend a single student from their school. I’m the top second (or third, I’m not sure) of my shitty school(what do I mean by this? [See last paragraph](http://wildkidappeared.tumblr.com/post/150071956035/goals)), and the first isn’t interested for reasons, so I’m next up for recommendation. I’m for certain I’m not going to be selected, because on their recommendation instructions, they have mentioned that the student being recommended must have ranked rank two or above(top 11% or above) for most of the subjects in school. Unfortunately, I ranked rank 3 for Earth Science this term. It’s really unfortunate because I ranked rank 1 for everything else. Well, excluding Chemistry(rank 2). But despite the rank for Earth Science, my teacher wants send the recommendation form anyway. So I’m sitting here in front of a computer in our school’s i-lecture viewing room writing this.

I have to write a ‘Why do I want to join this camp?’ essay, but instead of being efficient and writing that instead, I’m going to talk about how I’m not going to get selected on a blog that nobody reads! Yay. Well, I was reading about the activities, and I’m not sure if I even want to join it. It’s not like I’m not going to write the essay, of course, but it’s something to think about and it might help me feeling okay once I get rejected after the evaluations. If anyone read my ‘Goals’ post, I’m dreaming to become a Cellular Agriculture Researcher, not an AI software, robotics, nano-tech, mechanical engineer. As far as I know, my field is as far from IT as any science field can get. Not that it doesn’t use any IT technology, but I’m sure I’m far from anything related to PGS Designing or/and Creative IT Designing. You don’t know what those words mean? Don’t worry, I don’t as well.

The only positives I have for writing the essay for the camp is, “Why not?”. I’m dreaming to admit in to this university anyway. Also, some IT studies won’t hurt my dreams, not at all. In fact, it might help me in some situations where I somehow link Biology with it to make my research better and easier. Fields of sciences are being utilized in a group more and more as time passes. By that, I mean you can’t just do Physics and make a VR Machine.

So now what? Why do I want to join this camp? Well, I am a student who is very concerned about the well being of the human race within the span of my lifetime. While we seem to be advancing further and further with technology, there are many things we dismiss that will eventually pile up in to a wall that blocks the survival of the human race. I dream to be one of the people who pause and look back at our progress, and mend any faults and problems we have in our tower of achievements before they fall apart. With the fact that IT is becoming more and more important in our lives in mind, I am applying as a candidate to have the chance to learn and experience what the camp can provide me and hopefully utilize it in my future research, so that the next future can be a better one.

Yeah... that’s what I’m going to tell them.

Edit: Apparently I was suppose to write it like a self-introductory essay despite what it literally asked me to write. So I changed it up with the help of my teacher, being able to tell them my ability to speak English more fluent than any Korean. Honestly, that’s my only catch. If they don’t find that interesting enough to get me in the camp, nothing will.
