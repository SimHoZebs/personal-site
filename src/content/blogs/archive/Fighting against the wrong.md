One of my biggest fears is whether I will be able to fight against the things that I find oppressing, correct who I find wrong, and just generally voice out my opinion.

If I were to give an example, there was a moment in my PE Class. In Korea, we for some reason have written tests for PE. The test was tomorrow, but it personally wasn’t a big deal to me, because:

It was just a tiny test, nothing like a term exam/assessment.
Since I’m not aiming to be an athlete or a PE teacher, PE was absolutely irrelevant to me. I mean, I enjoy sports(as in I find it fun, not that I’m good at it), but I don’t like memorizing the names of different types of badminton swings.
Our PE teacher gave us a single piece of paper, with badminton rules and swing names written on it, telling us that the test will have questions directly from the paper. I thought to myself, “I could probably memorize this 10 minutes before the test and still get decent marks although they don’t actually matter in my life. Since I have an entire hour to spend, I should go ahead and study Maths instead.”

I wasn’t the only one thinking this - significant amount of students don’t give a shit about PE. But when we pulled our Maths books out, he walked up to one of us and told him put our books away and study the paper. Not even in a scolding way - he sounded like a bully forcing a kid to follow his order. What I found extremely frustrating was despite the fact that he was just sitting doing his own work on his laptop, not teaching/lecturing the class, he was forcing us in a violent manner to study a subject we didn’t want to and need to. If he was teaching, I would understand that out of respect I should listen to his class. But like I said, he was doing his own thing. Why couldn’t we do so as well? Is it wrong to make my own choices for my own exam marks? Am I being rude by doing what I want to do without hurting others? A teacher exists to show paths, not force one. This wasn’t teaching us morals - he was purely forcing his own will on to us.

I didn’t say anything. I was mad, but to be frank, I was also afraid to speak out to the bald giant who spoke violently towards students. And If I were to argue with him, I needed to be sure that I wasn’t bias and that I was logical. I spend the hour thinking of when I would speak to him, if I should just write it as a letter instead, or just report him to the ministry of education. But after all that thinking, I’m now sitting here having done nothing about what happened weeks ago.

I could say, “It’s something that happened once; I should be sure to say it if it happens again.” “Maybe it’s not a big deal. Just an hour, right? I could just deal with it every PE class.” But that is exactly what I absolutely hate. It is a product of my fear, an attempt to compensate and rationalize my action of doing no action at all. If I can’t do this now, what says I will be able to do anything like it in the future?

My second problem is whether I should even deal with some problems in the first place. To put an example, let me introduce you a classmate I have, ‘Pseofshit’. Pseofshit is a piece of shit in my class sitting at the back making noises with other pieces of shit. She is inconsiderate, selfish, noisy, and rude. One day, I happened to be on the same elevator with her in the school(our school has an elevator. Cool, right?). There were freshmen on it riding it to the third floor, while our destination was the fifth.

She said, loudly, “How selfish; Kids should be using the fucking stairs if it’s just three floors!”

I immediately thought of telling her off the third floor and make her walk to the fifth. It’s the same three floors, she should be okay with it, right? She referred them as ‘kids’, as if, she’s all grown up after 2 years. Pseofshit, a grown up? Give me a fucking break. Also, how does it not get through her head that she used to do the same when she was a freshmen herself? Why does she care so much?(And why do I care so much) Is it so unbearable to sacrifice a bit of her comfort for comfort of others?

I didn’t say anything. I’m too much of a coward to argue with people offline without shaking. My body just can’t handle arguments against people I’m not close with. All I'm now doing is be a bitch on the internet, writing a pathetic blog about it. Is it something I should have dealt with? I don’t think with Pseofshit’s personality I would’ve heard anything but offensive words without even having a word through her skull, but should I have humiliated her in front of the innocent freshmen? Should I have at least voice my opinion about how wrong her thinking is? Should I even deal with people like her? Is “It’s not worth talking to” an excuse?

I’m worried.
