title: I Didn't Expect To Study Computer Science
summary: I had this detailed plan of getting a PhD in cellular agriculture. I was so dedicated to pursue bioengineering, I studied an additional year after high school so I could join one of the best bioengineering school in Korea with a decent scholarship. "This is it," I thought. "I'm finally going to study exactly what I want to study." Now, it’s 2023, and I’m an international student in the US studying computer science with more than $40k in debt. How did I get here?

I had this detailed plan of getting a PhD in cellular agriculture through a Fellowship at Tufts University. I was so dedicated to pursue bioengineering, I studied an additional year after high school so I could join one of the best bioengineering school in Korea with a decent scholarship. "This is it," I thought. "I'm finally going to study exactly what I want to study."

Now, it’s 2023, and I’m an international student in the US studying computer science with more than $40k in debt.

## Before the Internet

I went by most of my life without considering computer science as my major. In fact, I went by most of my childhood without thinking much at all. I just did whatever I enjoyed whether I was good at them or not. My earliest interest include computer games like many kids, but where I really invested my time in back in primary school was in drawing comics. During class, my friends and I would share a sheet of paper or an exercise book and pass it around after drawing a cell or two. It'd create an unpredictable, random story we enjoyed. We'd also draw short comics on our own and share it with each other. I eventually took this more seriously and started a long term comic with characters and story inspired from my previous drawings. There was not much of a story, but the characters were based around my friends, which was good enough for my classmates to enjoy. This lasted for about 2 years, and I never completed the comic as I grew more conscious about the lacking story and drawing skills.

However, I didn't stop drawing entirely. Creating RPG on books became popular among my friends around 5th grade; the creator of the game would be the 'game master', who drew and erased sceneries and characters to simulate gameplay based on the narratives the players built on it. I never played DnD, but I imagine this is somewhat like that. Mine was a sandbox game where you start on an island, build your base, and invade other islands with the army you build along the way. It was kind of like RimWorld, except much shittier. This game got pretty popular among my friends and we played almost every break we had between classes. Unintentionally, this was the first time I made any kind of money. The cosmetic upgrades I offered at the game shop sold for real money, and my friends actually bought them. That’s right - I invented microtransactions in 2008.

## The Internet, then YouTube

As my age hit double digits, internet became a little more accessible; enough for me to read cringey romance novels. More popular ones from Korea were shared as .txt files, whereas the ones my friends wrote were shared as notes in our Facebook groups. I tried writing my own, but I gave up after writing about two chapters. There was a rising entertainment platform called YouTube, where I watched my first anime and skits from YouTubers like Smosh. I tried making these too, solely relying on pause/resume button on my phone camera. If even one thing went wrong, we were back to recording the first scene. It was quite an unfortunate time to be oblivious to a video editor software. At some point, I discovered stick figure animations and was inspired to make my own. I quick-tapped pause/resume button to record stop-motion animations until I learned how to animate using Microsoft PowerPoint. (Thanks, cstyle12 (I'm sure that is his name, but it seems like he deleted all the videos)). Eventually, I learned to animate on Macromedia Flash, thanks to artists like Hyun. I spent a decent amount of time learning keyframe interpolation, and various animation techniques, and even made a 15 second long clip of a guy fighting a wall.

It didn’t take long for me to discover my first Minecraft video, which I weirdly remember to this day: it was the COD zombie mod showcase by CaptainSparklez. That led to discovering AntVenom, YogsCast, Sky, EditZP, and many others that I don’t even remember anymore. I watched their playthroughs religiously, and was instantly hooked on the game.

After some time, I started to find slight frustrations with the Minecraft content on YouTube. These YouTubers were either missing the obvious or lacked game knowledge. They weren't being as efficient as they could be. I believed I could play better than them, and to prove it, I started my own YouTube channel and show people how you truly play Minecraft. The best player[^the-best].

## My First 'Career' - YouTube

The word “career” wasn’t on my mind when I started uploading videos, but it was the first time I actively tried to make something for the world to see. I spent all day recording mod reviews and adventure map playthroughs, then went to sleep with my laptop rendering videos overnight. I started with no money, a pirated copy of Minecraft and FRAPS (a recording software popular before OBS existed), random free video editor, and my terrible laptop with half a gig of RAM (That's right; 512MB RAM in 2012). By the peak of my YouTube career, I gathered around 5000 subscribers and became a partner at TGN because they let me receive revenue through PayPal (YouTube limited to checks with minimum $100 withdrawal). It wasn't a lot, of course, but it was enough to buy games for friends who had cash in their hands but couldn’t ask their parents. I eventually bought myself Minecraft, too. It was also the first time I went to a bank, pulled out a check from Google, and gave my mom.

YouTube was an incredible experience, but my channel was fragile. Despite all the effort I put in my videos, most of them performed poorly. Vast majority of my views and subscribers came from a handful of videos, with just a single video being responsible for more than half of them. When I left TGN to pursue better partners, most of my best performing videos were coincidentally taken down. This was when I realized that being fun wasn't easy. I wasn't a great entertainer.

## Engineering

Like I said, I never considered YouTube a career. What I did consider was something related with engineering, though I'm not sure what exactly got me into it. It seems that I have inherent passion in making things on my own. When I learned to animate, I also tried to make point-and-click games with Powerpoint, and simple games with Macromedia Flash. As I played Minecraft, I tried to make a mod of the book-based RPG I used to host in elementary school. Not only is Java a complex language already, learning to make a mod without basic understanding of programming was way too difficult for my 12~14 year old brain. I still managed to implement different properties and made custom blocks and enjoyed doing it. I believe this was my first sign to become a software developer.

However, I was more interested in mechanical engineering. I turned 14, I competed in a nation-wide engineering competition called MASMO Iken Scientifica at 14, and I was extremely interested in Physics. My two friends and I would casually share our understanding of our universe, discussing whether light was a particle or a wave, about the big bang and the universe's expansion, and so on. One of my favorite books I read as a kid was 'Physics of the Impossible' by Michio Kaku, which opened my eyes to the world of physics and engineering. However, I fell out of love with Physics when I learned about quantum mechanics (my child brain refused to believe the world worked that way), allowing me to stay loyal to pure mechanical engineering.

By 2015, I had a clear goal in mind - to build remotely controllable humanoid robots. The idea is pretty much the same as in Iron Man 3, where Tony sits in a toilet to control one of his suits before it smashes into pieces from a truck (though my inspiration came from elsewhere). I believed that would allow people to work in or explore areas too dangerous for real humans to exist in. Imagine if we could conduct lunar missions from Earth, remotely controlling a humanoid robot sitting on the Moon! Or imagine going on a trip to the other side of the planet without the hassle of physical travel. You could remote into one of the robots and explore the world as if you were actually there. This technology would not only benefit the physical world, but serve as a stepping stone to our inevitable future - virtual reality[^1].

## Shift to Biotech

I was never interested in Biology. It was just a boring subject that I happened to score better than Physics. But one day, I began to question the value of remotely controllable humanoid robots. In a world where with countless other problems, I found it hard to justify its necessity. None of this mattered if our society wasn't around to use it. I needed the world to be sustainable first before I could build fun things; so I went back to the drawing board and wrote down all the major global issues I was aware of. I drew a diagram showing the relationship between land pollution & scarcity, water pollution & scarcity, world hunger, air pollution, excess waste and lacking management, etc. This short reflection resulted with a shocking conclusion: agriculture needs a revolution.

I say "shocking", because it never occurred to me that producing food was unsustainable. I mean, haven't we been doing that since existence?
