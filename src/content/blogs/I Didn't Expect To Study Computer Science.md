title: I Didn't Expect To Study Computer Science
summary: I had this detailed plan of getting a PhD in cellular agriculture. I was so dedicated to pursue bioengineering, I studied an additional year after high school so I could join one of the best bioengineering school in Korea with a decent scholarship. "This is it," I thought. "I'm finally going to study exactly what I want to study." Now, it’s 2023, and I’m an international student in the US studying computer science with more than $40k in debt. How did I get here?
