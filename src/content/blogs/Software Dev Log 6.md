2020/SEP/1st - 2020/OCT/1st

I’m not sure if I’m just falling into a slump or my mental health isn’t doing well this month (like how it does every few months), but I haven’t done much in the last 2 weeks. I also have real life stuff to blame, like how I was extra busy with work and preparing for an anniversary with my girlfriend, but nonetheless I haven’t been feeling too hot. I think I should be getting back on track starting today(22nd) and be productive again.

Anyway, hence why I haven’t much to say for this entry.

I was busy catching up with reading the books until 11th. I’ve been progressing way faster than when I used to write notes. Now I'm way behind, but I should get back to reading soon.

I got accepted to the closed beta for Github Codespace! I haven’t done much with it, and probably won’t for a long time. The plan was to use it at work but I found out our intranet doesn’t allow it. RIP.

I’ve swapped from using **Todoist** to **Asana**. Not only can it do what Todoist can, it also replaces **Trello**. I initially had **Notion** as Trello’s replacement, but it’s terrible on Android, which is where I frequently look at.

That's um... pretty much it for this entry. I easily get stressed over being unproductive, which is unhelpful, because stress keeps me from feeling motivated. I'm trying to get my shit together. Hopefully I'll have more to say for the next Dev Log.
